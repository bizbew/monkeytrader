PERSONAL COMMITMENT

Soon in September 31st 2016, I will have made huge decision in choosing my life path.

Current situation to find money for a living by working month by month. However, contribution proportion will be more from higher responsibilities. The means are not the way it used to be. It can not meet an End. Thank you for gratitude in actuarial career. From now on, I would firmly make the statement that “One day, I will be the well-known investor in the world”. I am not smart but would be called great effort person, known by others as “Teleport Investor”.

My leave does not mean I am lazy or enjoying slow life anything. I promise that I would yet be more diligent. However, I did this because I would have time to develop myself everyday in terms of mentally, physically, spiritually and socially.

Honestly, since I graduated I felt I am lucky to have everyone supporting me. However, I am not that open-mindedly receive their kindness. Instead, I would rather support other people in my family. Remind for those whom I work with, giving and sharing are the way you will grow up and be more like a human-being. Everyone around like to think my life is so comfortable but they won’t know what is behind the scene.

When you view people used their lives freely and comfortably, you misunderstand reality behind. View another side of the coin to understand people more. The truth is the more they relax, the more suffering they had faced.
